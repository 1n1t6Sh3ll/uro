# uru
Using a URL list for security testing can be painful as there are a lot of URLs that have uninteresting/duplicate content; `uro` aims to solve that.

#### Usage
First, install uro with pip:
```
pip3 install uro
```
Now, there's just one way to use it, no args, no bullshit.
```
cat urls.txt | uro
```
